Welcome to the project.

We are building a calculator app.
There will be four modules. Add, subtract, multiply and divide.

Jayanti will work in the Add module.

Anuska will add in the subtract module

Rajani will add in the multiply module

Aaki will add in the subtract module

The file you will be working on will be calculator_app.py

Some portion of code will be displayed on screen. 

Happy coding.
